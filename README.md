# Zig2GBA 🕹️⚡

This repo is an adaptation of the Tonc Guide for GBA programming. 
Tonc is a GameBoy Advance / GameBoy Advance SP programming tutorial originally written by Jasper Vijn.
  - The tutorial is clear, informative, and really cool.
  - It's an excellent resource; check it out here ---> https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/intro.htm

^^ The above is written in C. Zig is great for maintaining things written in C.

### _Tonc Guide_
- The Tonc Guide was written by Jasper Vijn (cearn at coranac dot com) via a WordPress website. 
-  The following is from: https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/intro.htm
_This distribution is provided as is, without warranty of any kind. I cannot be held liable for any damage arising out of the use or inability to use this distribution. Code has been tested on emulator and real hardware as well as I could, but I can't guarantee 100% correctness._
_The code may be used and/or modified as you see fit. The text and code were intended to go together; if you have to separate the text from the code, at least provide a link to where both originated (i.e., this site)._
_Both text and code can be modified by me at any time. Check in once in a while to see if anything's changed. Time stamps are at the bottom of every page, and at the top of all source-files. There is also a log in the appendices._
_ OK that's it. Have fun._
