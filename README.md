# Zig2GBA üïπÔ∏è‚ö°

This repo maintains a legacy C library and website supporting the Nintendo _Game Boy Advance_ & _GameBoy Advance SP_. 

_Tonc_ is a GameBoy Advance / GameBoy Advance SP programming tutorial originally written by Jasper Vijn.
  - The tutorial is clear, informative, and really cool.
  - It's an excellent resource; check it out here and deserver to be maintained

## [This repo's wiki is hoping to maintain the following ](https://github.com/ChromiteExabyte/Zig2GBA/wiki)

### 1.  Tonc text
- _"The text section covers the principles of GBA programming in detail... Every chapter has one of more demonstrations of the covered theory, and a brief discussion of the demo itself."_




### 2. Tonc code
- _ The source code to all the demos mentioned in the text can be found in the code directory. Like the text, the code is divided into 3 main parts: basic, extended and advanced._
-
- The basic projects are (hopefully) pretty newbie friendly. They're completely self-contained so you can toy with them and not worry about screwing up other parts. The extended projects take their GBA-related code from

#### tonclib, a library with all my #defines and important functions. 

The advanced demos also use tonclib liberally and will use some assembly files, even if it is just for data. There is also a lab directory with a few interesting projects, but which might not be quite ready. Still interesting to look at, though._

Unlike most GBA tutorials, tonc uses makefiles

_The guide to the GBA programming has basic, intermediate, and advanced levels of depth._
_The guide is very clear in explaining systems programming, memory management, and compiling from

### _Tonc Guide_
- The Tonc Guide was written by Jasper Vijn (cearn at coranac dot com) and is presently  via a WordPress website. 
-  The following is from: https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/intro.htm
_This distribution is provided as is, without warranty of any kind. I cannot be held liable for any damage arising out of the use or inability to use this distribution. Code has been tested on emulator and real hardware as well as I could, but I can't guarantee 100% correctness._

_The code may be used and/or modified as you see fit. The text and code were intended to go together; if you have to separate the text from the code, at least provide a link to where both originated (i.e., this site)._

_Both text and code can be modified by me at any time. Check in once in a while to see if anything's changed. Time stamps are at the bottom of every page, and at the top of all source-files. There is also a log in the appendices._

_ OK that's it. Have fun._
