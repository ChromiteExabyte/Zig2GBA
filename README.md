# Zig2GBA

This repo is an adaptation of the Tonc Guide to GBA Programming for the Zig Language. 

Tonc is a GameBoy Advance / GameBoy Advance SP programming tutorial originally written by Jasper Vijn.
  - The tutorial is clear, informative, and really cool.
  - It's an excellent resource; check it out here ---> https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/intro.htm


Tonc Community Edition is a port of the the above to a GitHub repo w/ Markdown code
        Check it out here ---> https://gbadev.net/tonc/


This is a personal project and may have errors.


Zig2GBA may be redundant, as there is ZigGBA repo ---> https://github.com/wendigojaeger/ZigGBA
+ A ZigGBA SDK would be excellent ; the Tonc Tutorial & GBA development kit in are distinct cans of beans, IMO. 
+ This repo focuses on the Tonc guide, because I don't know what is covered by the scope of an SDK and the C code can be clearly adapted.
