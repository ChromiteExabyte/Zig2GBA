# Zig2GBA üïπÔ∏è‚ö°

This repo maintains a legacy C library and website supporting the Nintendo _Game Boy Advance_ & _GameBoy Advance SP_. 

_Tonc_ is a GameBoy Advance / GameBoy Advance SP programming tutorial originally written by Jasper Vijn.

## Stuff that can be maintained with Zig here

### 1.  Tonc text
- _"The text section covers the principles of GBA programming in detail... Every chapter has one of more demonstrations of the covered theory, and a brief discussion of the demo itself."_

+ Tonc text is all of the info / tutorial things that are not code or binary
+ It's good archival / stewardship practice to save original versions before adapting to Zig
+ The demonstations and text are clear straightforward examples of C (or Zig) code
 If Zig can maintain and build upon C code, then we can build upon C tutorials and reference materials !

^^ This is an example of the _Tonc_ text



### 2. Tonc code
- _"The source code to all the demos mentioned in the text can be found in the code directory. Like the text, the code is divided into 3 main parts: basic, extended and advanced."_

+ We can maintain this with Zig incrementally
+ ...this could be a good place to start for anyone who needs an excuse to work on Zig.
+ The codebase varies from Basic to Advanced, and so it can adapt as Basic to Advanced Zig Tutorials
.
.
The example code can be adapted to Zig tutorials as well as the Zig language / compiler

### 3. Tonc binaries 

_"Unlike most GBA tutorials, tonc uses makefiles._"

The Zig compiler is really good and stuff
I'm coming from C# / Python, so this section is WIP

### _Tonc Guide_
- The Tonc Guide was written by Jasper Vijn (cearn at coranac dot com) and is presently  via a WordPress website. 
-  The following is from: https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/intro.htm

_This distribution is provided as is, without warranty of any kind. I cannot be held liable for any damage arising out of the use or inability to use this distribution. Code has been tested on emulator and real hardware as well as I could, but I can't guarantee 100% correctness._

_The code may be used and/or modified as you see fit. The text and code were intended to go together; if you have to separate the text from the code, at least provide a link to where both originated (i.e., this site)._

_Both text and code can be modified by me at any time. Check in once in a while to see if anything's changed. Time stamps are at the bottom of every page, and at the top of all source-files. There is also a log in the appendices._

_ OK that's it. Have fun._

The _Tonc_ guide an excellent resource and I am thankful that this work was created (and that the website is still running!)

### Zig Language 

https://ziglang.org/

Zig is pretty cool and I'm thankful for all the effort that goes into the language and compiler development 

as a student, it's exciting to be able to learn Zig before C / C++
